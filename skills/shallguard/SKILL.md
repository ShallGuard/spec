# ShallGuard requirement traceability

This manual is for a coding agent that works in a repository that uses
ShallGuard. It is the same for every language. The directory of this skill
holds one file per language, for example `rust.md`. Read the file of the
language of the code that you change. It gives the syntax of the anchors
and the name of the command.

ShallGuard checks the link between three things: numbered requirements in
Markdown documents, the code that makes each requirement true, and the
tests that verify it. In a repository that uses ShallGuard, the requirement
documents are the specification of the codebase. Every behavior change must
keep the three-way link intact. The command `shallguard check` is the gate.
This manual calls it the check.

This manual writes every command as `shallguard <command>`. The language
file gives the real invocation. In Rust it is `cargo shallguard <command>`.

You detect ShallGuard by the file `shallguard.toml` at the root of the
repository. That file names the requirement documents and their source
roots. Read it first. It tells you which document owns which code.

## The model

- **Requirement.** A requirement has the ID `REQ-<AREA>-<NNN>` and lives in
  a selected Markdown document. It has three parts: a testable statement in
  RFC 2119 form (SHALL / SHALL NOT / MAY), an `*Enforced:*` line that names
  the file and the symbol that implements it, and a `*Verified:*` line that
  names the evidence class. An ID is stable forever. A retired ID is never
  used again.
- **Enforcement anchor.** A mark on the code item that makes the
  requirement true, or inside the block of statements that makes it true.
  The language file gives the syntax.
- **Verification anchor.** A mark on a test that verifies the requirement.
  The language file gives the syntax.
- **Evidence marks** on a `*Verified:*` line: `[test]` an anchored
  automated test, `[e2e]` an end-to-end or production validation,
  `[review]` a code review only, `[pending]` pending. The emoji ✅, 🔬, 👁,
  and ⏳ are optional aliases. `shallguard fmt` adds the keyword before an
  emoji and keeps the emoji, for example `[test] ✅`. The commands
  `fmt --check` and `lint` accept an emoji without a keyword. Only `[test]`
  requires a verification anchor and a citation with a file and a test
  name. The check compares the `[test]` claim with the anchor.

ShallGuard finds anchors only in the form that the language file defines.
**A requirement ID in any other place is not an anchor.** A `REQ-...`
string in a free comment or in a string literal does nothing. It does not
satisfy traceability, and the check does not validate it.

## Workflow: requirements first

For **new behavior**, do these steps in this order, all in the same change
set:

1. **Write the requirement before the implementation.** Use the next free
   `REQ-<AREA>-NNN` in the document that owns the area. Write the SHALL
   statement, the `*Enforced:*` target, and `*Verified:* [pending]`. You
   can explore before you write the requirement. The final implementation
   pass starts from the written requirement. New behavior without a
   requirement is an incomplete change. If a merge or a rebase collides on
   the number, the branch that rebases takes the next free ID. An ID becomes
   stable when the change merges into the default branch, not at draft
   time. The check catches a rename that reaches the document but not the
   anchors.
2. **Implement the behavior and anchor the enforcement site.**
3. **Write the test and anchor it with a verification anchor.** Only then
   change `[pending]` to `[test]`, with a citation that names the exact
   test file and test name:

   ```markdown
   *Verified:* [test] `prefix:path/to/test_file` (`test_name`)
   ```

4. **Run the gate** before you report the work as done. The gate is
   described below.

**If you change code near an anchor,** read the requirement first. If the
behavior changes, update the requirement text in the same change. If the
code only moves, move the anchor with it.

**If you remove behavior,** mark the requirement as `*(retired ...)*` in the
document and remove its anchors. Never delete the entry. Never use the ID
again.

## Anchor rules

- Put the enforcement anchor on the item that implements the SHALL
  statement. Do not put it on the nearest public function. One item can
  enforce several requirements. One requirement can have anchors at
  several sites.
- Use the statement form of the enforcement anchor, when the language has
  one, for a branch or a sequence of statements that an item-level anchor
  cannot reach.
- Put a verification anchor only on a real test, the one that the test
  runner of the language executes. A test that is skipped or ignored
  cannot carry a verification anchor. There is no statement form for
  verification.
- The check flags one test that claims 6 or more requirements as an
  outlier.
- The format of an anchor ID is validated. A typo like `REQ-HSR-002` is an
  error. The language file names the cheapest check that finds it.

## Comments next to anchors

A comment can explain why the code at an anchor makes a requirement true.
The comment is text for a reader. It is never an anchor, and the check does
not read it. The anchor stays mandatory. The IDs live only in the anchor.
Do not repeat them in the comment. A list in a comment can drift from the
anchor, and the check does not compare the two.

Put the explanation in a block before the anchor. Start the block with the
line `Requirements:` and nothing else on that line. Separate it from an
existing comment with one empty comment line. The language file shows the
form for its comment syntax.

## Evidence honesty

These rules are hard rules.

- **Read the test before you anchor it.** Put a verification anchor only
  on a test that FAILS when the requirement is violated. A test that only
  runs the enforcing code path is not enough.
- Never write `[test]` in a document without a verification anchor that
  resolves and a citation that names the exact test file and test name.
  Never invent a citation that looks plausible.
- If no targeted test exists, use the honest class: `[e2e]`, `[review]`, or
  `[pending]`. A `[pending]` is a to-do item, not a failure. A false
  `[test]` is a failure.
- Never weaken the text of a requirement, and never make it vague, to make
  a check pass.

## The gate

Run these commands before you report the work as done:

```bash
shallguard check          # full traceability cross-check
shallguard fmt --check    # after any requirement-document edit
shallguard fmt            # fix doc formatting (never hand-wrap
                          # requirement blocks yourself)
```

- Run `check` with **no document argument**, so that `shallguard.toml`
  selects every document. A run with one document scans only the source
  roots of that document, and it reports anchors in other source roots as
  missing.
- The `fmt` command refuses to write if a selected document is malformed.
  It changes only requirement list blocks. It verifies that the format
  change did not change the meaning of a statement or of the evidence.
- After you fix or retire a gap that is in the baseline, run
  `shallguard baseline prune`. Commit the removal together with the fix. A
  stale baseline entry is itself a failure.
- If the repository has no ShallGuard CI job yet, the local run IS the
  gate. Never skip it because "CI will catch it".
- If the repository has a friction log at `docs/FRICTION.md`, use it. When
  the gate or the workflow causes friction while you work, add a one-line
  entry in the same change set. Never work around friction in silence.

## Never do

- Never edit the baseline file `.shallguard/baseline.toml` by hand. Never
  try to add an entry. There is no command that adds an entry. New debt
  cannot be accepted, only fixed. The baseline is a ratchet.
- Never remove an anchor, delete or reword a requirement, or downgrade
  evidence only to remove a check failure. Fix what the failure points at.
- Never skip or ignore an anchored test.
- Never invent or guess a requirement ID. An ID in code that no document
  defines is a hard failure.
- Never use a retired requirement ID again.

## Respond to `check` failures

| Failure | Correct response |
|---|---|
| An ID in code is not defined in any document | Add the requirement, or fix the typo. Never delete the anchor without a reason. |
| Two requirements have the same ID | Renumber the newer one and its anchors. |
| A `[test]` claim has no anchored test | Write and anchor the test, or downgrade honestly to `[pending]`. |
| A `[test]` citation names no real test file or test | Complete the citation with the real file and test name. |
| A cited path does not exist | Fix the citation to the real file. Never invent a path. |
| The cited enforcement file has no anchor with the ID | Anchor the real enforcement site. Never move the anchor to a file that only mentions the code. |
| A baseline entry is stale | Run `shallguard baseline prune` and commit the removal. |
| The document does not parse | Fix the document structure. The command `fmt --check` points at the structural error. |
| `fmt --check` reports a document as non-canonical | Run `shallguard fmt`. It also adds the keyword before an emoji evidence alias, which `fmt --check` does not require. |

## Adopt ShallGuard in a new repository

1. Create `shallguard.toml` at the root of the repository. This is the
   minimal shape. All paths are relative to the repository. The loader
   rejects unknown fields:

   ```toml
   schema = 1
   minimum_requirements = 1
   baseline = ".shallguard/baseline.toml"
   verify_outlier_threshold = 6

   [[documents]]
   path = "docs/USER_STORIES_AND_REQUIREMENTS.md"
   source_root = "."

   # Optional path aliases used in *Enforced:*/*Verified:* citations,
   # e.g. `core:src/lib.rs`.
   [prefixes]
   core = "packages/core"

   [areas.CLI]
   label = "Command Line"
   hard_enforcement = true
   hard_verification = true

   [artifacts]
   root = "target/shallguard"
   ```

   In a repository with several packages, add one `[[documents]]` entry for
   each requirement document. Set `source_root` to the directory of the
   package that owns the document. The language file names the directories
   that ShallGuard scans below every source root and every prefix.
2. Write the requirement document. Use numbered `REQ-<AREA>-NNN` entries
   with SHALL statements and with Enforced and Verified lines. Run
   `shallguard fmt` to normalize the structure.
3. Anchor the existing code and tests honestly. Follow the rules above. Add
   the ShallGuard package of the language only to the packages that carry
   anchors. The language file names the package.
4. If the existing code has gaps that you cannot avoid, create the baseline
   **once** with `shallguard baseline init` and commit it. An empty
   baseline is best. Each entry is debt. The entry blocks edits of the text
   of that requirement until the gap is resolved.
5. Set `hard_enforcement` or `hard_verification` of an area to `true` as
   soon as the area has no gap of that kind. A hard area cannot go into the
   baseline. The ratchet only moves forward.
6. Add `shallguard check` and `shallguard fmt --check` to CI when a build
   image with the command is available. Until then, the local run is the
   gate.

## Analysis and review pipeline

Run these commands only on request. They are for change review and for
evidence audits. They are not gates. Do not run them on every edit. The
`coverage` and `review` commands are expensive. The `review` and
`review show` commands are experimental: they need a language model
provider, and they can change in any release. The language file names the
tools that `coverage` needs.

```bash
# Which requirements does this diff touch? Direct, transitive (one
# syntax-derived reverse-dependency hop), and structural impacts.
shallguard impact --base <merge-base> \
  --json requirement-impact.json --markdown requirement-impact.md

# Resolve every verification anchor to an exact test identity.
shallguard test-index --enumerate --json requirement-tests.json

# Run only the anchored tests under a coverage tool and check that the
# covered regions intersect the enforcement scopes. "Covered" means
# reached, not correct.
shallguard coverage --requirement REQ-<AREA>-NNN \
  --json requirement-coverage.json

# One-command local semantic review (experimental): impact -> impacted-test
# selection -> coverage -> capsule bundle -> LLM review. Defaults: --target
# origin/master (falls back per repo config), --with-coverage,
# --provider codex; "claude" and "copilot" are the other providers. May
# send bounded source capsules to a hosted model service. Confirm that this
# is acceptable for the repository before you run it. Use --local-provider
# ollama|lmstudio for on-device Codex inference.
shallguard review

# Housekeeping: continue an interrupted review, reuse validated
# responses, remove the default generated bundle.
shallguard review --resume
shallguard review --cache-dir .cache/shallguard-review
shallguard clean
```

The verdicts from `review` are advisory. The gates `check` and
`fmt --check` never depend on network access or on a model.
