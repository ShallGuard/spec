# Documentation style

All documents in every ShallGuard repository use ASD-STE100 (Simplified
Technical English). Write for a reader who has no previous knowledge of
ShallGuard, requirements engineering, or coding agents. This page gives the
rules.

## Sentences

- Write short sentences. Use a maximum of 20 words in an instruction and a
  maximum of 25 words in a description.
- Put one topic in one sentence. Put one instruction in one sentence.
- Use the active voice. Say who or what does the action. Write "the check
  reports an error", not "an error is reported".
- Use the present tense for descriptions. Use the imperative for
  instructions: "Run the check", not "You should run the check" or "The check
  should be run".
- Use "must" for a rule. Use "can" for a possibility or a permission. Do not
  use "should", "may", "might", or "could" in prose.
- Keep the words SHALL, SHALL NOT, and MAY only inside a requirement
  statement, where RFC 2119 defines them. Do not use them in ordinary text.
- Do not use dashes, semicolons, or parentheses to join two thoughts. Start a
  new sentence.
- Do not start a sentence with a verb form that ends in "-ing". Do not use
  such forms as verbs ("checking the link" becomes "the tool checks the
  link").
- Use the articles "a", "an", and "the". Do not remove them to make a sentence
  shorter.
- Do not put more than three nouns in a row. Write "the root of the
  repository", not "repository root directory path".

## Paragraphs and lists

- Put one topic in one paragraph. Use a maximum of six sentences in a
  paragraph.
- Start a paragraph with the most important sentence.
- Use a vertical list for steps and for sets of parallel items. Use a
  numbered list for steps that have an order.
- Put a warning or a caution in its own sentence, before the step it applies
  to.

## Words

- Use one word for one thing. For example, always write "requirement", never
  "contract", "SHALL statement", "clause", or "spec item" for the same thing.
  The [glossary](GLOSSARY.md) lists the approved terms.
- Use simple words: "use" (not "utilize"), "start" (not "initiate"), "make
  sure" (not "ensure"), "for example" (not "e.g."), "that is" (not "i.e.").
- Do not use idioms, metaphors, jokes, or slang. Write "the tool finds the
  missing tests", not "the tool digs up the missing tests".
- Do not use words with two meanings in the same document. For example, do
  not use "check" both as a noun for the command and as a verb for what a
  person does. Write "run the check" and "examine the result".
- Explain each technical term the first time you use it, or link to the
  glossary. This includes terms from a programming language and from Git,
  such as "crate", "Cargo workspace", "merge request", and "CI".
- Write numbers as digits. Write "3 crates", not "three crates".
- Spell out an abbreviation the first time you use it: "continuous integration
  (CI)".

## Structure of a document

- Start with one paragraph that says what the document is for and who reads
  it.
- Use headings that name the topic. Do not use questions or jokes as
  headings.
- Keep code, commands, and file paths in code formatting. Do not put a
  command inside a sentence.
- Keep a code block or a table out of the flow of a sentence. Introduce it
  with a full sentence that ends with a colon.

## Why this style, and how to help

English is not the native language of the maintainer. The
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#language-and-editorial-contributions)
explains this, and it welcomes help with grammar, clarity, tone, and wording.
Simplified Technical English gives every contributor the same clear rules, so
that nobody has to rely on a native feel for the language.

An editorial pull request is a valued contribution. If a text reads unusual,
blunt, or ambiguous, assume good intent and ask. An editorial change to a
requirement statement must keep its technical meaning. Treat a change of
meaning as a specification change, not as a grammar correction.
